# Fashion-Store-Predictive-Analytics
Predictive analytics of the average rating of some products in the fashion store. Highly rated products can be promoted to improve sales and revenue.
Skills demonstrated were data manipulation and transfromation using pandas and scikit library, machine learning and predictive analytics using the scikit library.


Assumptions and objectives
After observing the profile of the dataset, the following assumptions and questions arose:
**Assumption:**

1.	The dataset is for a retail fashion company. It contains a list of all the brands, product id, the price, the ratings of the product and the number of times the products were rated along with other variables such as fabric type, pattern, and neck style.
2.	The products were rated after purchase; hence, rating count can as well be the number of times the products were purchased.
3.	The company wants insight on the data. Companies usually want to maximise profits, retain customers, maintain market share, or minimise costs.

Putting in perspective the type of business insights required by businesses, the more applicable ones to this dataset are listed below:

Product popularity and performance: By analysing the ratings and sales data, the most popular and successful products, as well as those that are performing poorly can be identified. This can help the business identify trends and make informed decisions about which products to focus on.

Customer preferences and trends: By analysing the product attributes, such as colour, occasion, pattern, etc., insights into the preferences and tastes of the customers can be gained. This can help the business tailor their marketing and product offerings to better meet the needs and desires of their target audience.

Marketing strategies: By analysing the data on brand name, price, and ratings, you can evaluate the effectiveness of different marketing strategies can be evaluated and identifying which ones are most successful at driving sales and customer satisfaction.


Due to constraints and missing values, the best question to answer was on product popularity and performance. Hence, the performance of the product was predicted.
